# Medick : Integrated HealthBot and Appointment Booking System for Remote Healthcare
The Integrated HealthBot and Appointment Booking System project aims to address the challenges of remote healthcare by developing a comprehensive platform 
that combines a user-friendly appointment booking system with an AI-powered healthbot. The platform will allow patients to schedule appointments with
healthcare providers easily while also providing personalized health assistance and remote monitoring capabilities through a virtual health assistant.
### This integrated healthcare platform is developed as part of the Future Ready Talent Internship program, a collaboration between Microsoft, Future Skills Prime, Quess, Github, and EY, aimed at fostering innovation in remote healthcare solutions.
